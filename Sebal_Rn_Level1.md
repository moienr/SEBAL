## Calculating Surface Radiation Balance Equation for Rn - Landsat C2 Level 1

Implementaion Based on the [SEBAL IDAHO](https://www.posmet.ufv.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MET-479-Waters-et-al-SEBAL.pdf)


## Calculating the ESUN values for Landsat 8 Level 2 products
Since Sebal needs ESUN and Albedo to be calulted, and these values are not provided in the L2 Products, I wrote this Notebook to better understand the derivation on these values.
